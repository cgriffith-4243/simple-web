This is a dynamic html/css/javascript website. This website is an artist portfolio that showcases artwork I (Cameron Griffith) have done over the past decade.

The header of this website is the title, "CGriffith Art", and the navigation bar. The user will be able to navigate the website to read artist information and view the artworks, organized by art medium. This website consists of four pages: Welcome, About, Gallery, Contact. The footer contains copyright information for the website.

Welcome page consists only of the title and background image art and is meant as a launchpad for the user's experience on the website.

Gallery page consists of images of the artworks, divided respectively by medium. The gallery may be filtered by medium. A custom css masonry style table organizes the images. The user can click on a portfolio image and a larger version of the image will be shown on the screen. The user can then use navigation arrows to cycle through the other images in the portfolio.
