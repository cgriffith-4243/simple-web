						<h2>About me...</h2>
						<p>Originally from <strong>San Diego, California</strong>, I hope to pursue a career in software development. I am currently a student studying <em>Computer Science</em> and <em>Art</em> at the <strong>University of Denver</strong>, graduating in Spring 2020.</p>
						<p>I have always had a passion for art and coding. This website is meant as a portfolio to showcase my projects in both fields and as a marriage between the two.</p>
